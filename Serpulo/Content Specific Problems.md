### Duo (v153)

_**Overview**_  
[Wiki Link](https://mindustrygame.github.io/wiki/blocks/348-duo/)  
"Fires alternating bullets at enemies."  
Duo is the first turret utilized that only costs copper. Has 3 ammo types: Copper, Graphite, and Silicon.

_Camapign_  
It generally faces off against T1 (such as Dagger or Crawler).  

1. Graphite is better than Silicon in most ways.
2. Boost amount is worse then usability in terms of Asymptotics
